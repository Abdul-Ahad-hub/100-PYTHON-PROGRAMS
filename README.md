These are 100 pythons programs, written by me, these programs are enough for someone who wants to have the complete surface level experience of what python has to offer, it exhibits all the things we can do using python, from file handling, loops to computer vision, AI and Web Scraping.
These are code snippets, spread accross dozens of files, with self explanatory functionality, well written and tested.
If anyone wants to learn python, practicing these programs will cover it all.
